NodeDynDNS
==========

Motivation
----------
I was looking for a way to have a dynamic DNS service to my home router so I
could make a game server (ARK: Survival Evolved) easily accessible to non-CS
people. There already was a server I could use and after quickly searching for
dynamic DNS software I decided I could develop something with appropriate use
application of OOP myself. So I started this project


Project Summary
---------------
- Pure JavaScript on node.js
- RFC 1035 compliant
- Website to update
